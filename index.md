My name is Tiffany, I am a freshman in highschool. My favorite colour is green and I like trees. I have a cat, an orange tabby named popcorn.

I also enjoy engaging in somnolence, especially at school.

# preferences
I prefer red vinegar over white vinegar
I prefer persimmon over oranges
I prefer triangles over squares
